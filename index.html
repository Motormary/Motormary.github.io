          <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we're committed to making science accessible to all.
            <br> <br>
            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire,
            wind, water,
            and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
            <br> <br>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
            discoveries and
            perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
            <br> <br>
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.
            This is
            why
            we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these
            exhibits
            are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur
            exhibits - they only come to life at night when everyone's gone home).

            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there's plenty to
            see
            and do.
            <br><br>
            You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet our
            resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you
            come
            ready to learn and explore.
            <br><br>
            We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you'll
            get
            to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
            <br><br>
            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on
            a
            journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club
            and
            how you can join, send us a message.

            <p>
              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
              Science Museum. It's a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements
              as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to 'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able
              to use and control wind to create power.
